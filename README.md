**Tessera.io** is an open-source, real-time collaborative IDE engine. It provides the raw infrastructure needed to build next-generation development tools: zero-latency CRDT document synchronization, a secure remote code execution environment, and an architecture designed natively for AI integration.

Standard cloud IDEs are built for humans. Tessera.io is built for the future: a secure arena where human developers and AI agents can write, test, and debug code together in real time.

## 🚀 Current State: The MVP

The current repository is the foundational MVP. We have established the core plumbing to allow real-time collaborative typing and remote code execution. 

*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Powered by Yjs (CRDTs) and Socket.io, ensuring deterministic, conflict-free state resolution across clients.
*   **The Editor:** React + TailwindCSS utilizing `@monaco-editor/react` for a native VS Code-like typing experience.
*   **Secure Execution Engine:** A Node.js worker utilizing BullMQ and the Docker Engine API to run untrusted code safely in isolated, ephemeral containers (with optional gVisor support).
*   **AI Service Foundation:** A lightweight Python/FastAPI service hooked into the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for RAG pipelines.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Monorepo Structure

Tessera.io uses a strict **Turborepo** monorepo via npm workspaces. This modular design allows open-source contributors to work on the exact layer they specialize in without needing to understand the entire stack.

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

Before starting, install the tools for your operating system:

* **Node.js** >= 20.0.0 and **npm** >= 10.0.0
* **Docker** or **Docker Desktop** (for the execution engine)
* **Redis** (for BullMQ task queues; a Docker container is fine)
* **MongoDB** (for AI service RAG storage; a Docker container is fine)
* **Python** >= 3.11 (for the AI microservice)

*Optional:*
* **gVisor** (`runsc`) for enhanced kernel isolation in the execution engine.

If the execution engine cannot reach Docker, hits WSL mount errors, or leaves behind interrupted sandbox containers, see the [Docker Sandbox Troubleshooting](docs/docker-sandbox-troubleshooting.md) guide.

### Clone and install

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:<your-username>/Tessera.io.git
cd Tessera.io
```

2. **Install all workspace dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Create your local environment file:**
```bash
cp .env.example .env
```

On Windows PowerShell:
```powershell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

### Linux setup

1. **Verify Node.js, npm, Docker, and Python:**
```bash
node --version
npm --version
docker version
python3 --version
```

2. **Start Docker if it is not already running:**
```bash
sudo systemctl start docker
```

3. **Start infrastructure services (Redis and MongoDB):**
```bash
# Start Redis (if not already running)
docker run -d --name tessera-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Start MongoDB (if not already running)
docker run -d --name tessera-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo:7
```

If a container with the same name already exists, start it instead:
```bash
docker start tessera-redis tessera-mongo
```

4. **Set up the Python AI service:**
```bash
cd apps/ai-service
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../..
```

5. **Start all services in development mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Windows setup

For the smoothest Windows experience, use Windows 11, PowerShell, and Docker Desktop with the WSL 2 backend enabled.

1. **Verify Node.js, npm, Docker Desktop, and Python:**
```powershell
node --version
npm --version
docker version
py -3.11 --version
```

If `py -3.11` is not available, use:
```powershell
python --version
```

2. **Start infrastructure services (Redis and MongoDB):**
```powershell
# Start Redis (if not already running)
docker run -d --name tessera-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Start MongoDB (if not already running)
docker run -d --name tessera-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo:7
```

If a container with the same name already exists, start it instead:
```powershell
docker start tessera-redis tessera-mongo
```

3. **Set up the Python AI service:**
```powershell
cd apps/ai-service
py -3.11 -m venv .venv
.\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ..\..
```

If `py -3.11` is unavailable, replace it with `python`. If PowerShell blocks virtual environment activation, run:
```powershell
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope CurrentUser RemoteSigned
```

Then reopen PowerShell and run the activation command again.

4. **Start all services in development mode:**
```powershell
npm run dev
```

### Verify your setup

Run these checks from the repository root before opening a pull request:

```bash
npm run typecheck
npm run build
npm run dev
```

When `npm run dev` is running, confirm the local services use the expected defaults:

* Redis is reachable on `localhost:6379`
* MongoDB is reachable on `localhost:27017`
* The sync server uses `PORT=4000`
* The frontend origin is `http://localhost:3000`

`npm run dev` concurrently starts the React frontend, the Socket.io sync server, the FastAPI service, and the BullMQ execution worker via Turborepo.


## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Plans

We are actively building out the next phases of Tessera.io. If you are looking to contribute, these are our major upcoming milestones:

### 🎓 Phase 2: The "Socratic Mentor" AI Layer

To combat the rise of "vibe coding" (where developers blindly copy-paste AI code), we are building a deeply integrated, learning-focused AI mode.

* **Interactive Scaffolding:** The AI will refuse to write complete solutions. Instead, it will generate code skeletons with missing logic gates and interactive `// TODO` comments via the CRDT stream.
* **Live Runtime Interrogation:** When code fails in the Docker sandbox, the AI will intercept the logs and ask the user guiding questions about their variables rather than just printing the fix.

### 🌐 Phase 3: Integrated WebRTC

* Adding an A/V Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) to enable seamless audio and video conferencing directly inside the collaborative workspace.
* Interactive multi-player whiteboard integration synced alongside the Monaco editor.

### 🐙 Phase 4: GitHub Integration

* Native OAuth GitHub app integration to fetch repositories, map file trees, and sync PRs and Issues directly into the workspace.
