**Tessera.io** is an open-source, real-time collaborative IDE engine. It provides the raw infrastructure needed to build next-generation development tools: zero-latency CRDT document synchronization, a secure remote code execution environment, and an architecture designed natively for AI integration.

Standard cloud IDEs are built for humans. Tessera.io is built for the future: a secure arena where human developers and AI agents can write, test, and debug code together in real time.

## 🚀 Current State: The MVP

The current repository is the foundational MVP. We have established the core plumbing to allow real-time collaborative typing and remote code execution. 

*   **Real-Time Collaboration:** Powered by Yjs (CRDTs) and Socket.io, ensuring deterministic, conflict-free state resolution across clients.
*   **The Editor:** React + TailwindCSS utilizing `@monaco-editor/react` for a native VS Code-like typing experience.
*   **Secure Execution Engine:** A Node.js worker utilizing BullMQ and the Docker Engine API to run untrusted code safely in isolated, ephemeral containers (with optional gVisor support).
*   **AI Service Foundation:** A lightweight Python/FastAPI service hooked into the Model Context Protocol (MCP) and MongoDB Atlas Vector Search for RAG pipelines.

## 🏗️ Architecture & Monorepo Structure

Tessera.io uses a strict **Turborepo** monorepo via npm workspaces. This modular design allows open-source contributors to work on the exact layer they specialize in without needing to understand the entire stack.

## 🛠️ Local Development Setup

### Prerequisites

* **Node.js** ≥ 20.0.0 and **npm** ≥ 10.0.0
* **Docker** (for the execution engine)
* **Redis** (for BullMQ task queues)
* **MongoDB** (for AI service RAG storage)
* **Python** ≥ 3.11 (for the AI microservice)

*Optional:*
* **gVisor** (`runsc`) for enhanced kernel isolation in the execution engine.

### Quick Start

1. **Clone the repository:**
```bash
git clone git@github.com:Kushaal-k/Tessera.io.git
cd Tessera.io
```

2. **Install all workspace dependencies:**
```bash
npm install
```

3. **Start infrastructure services (Redis & MongoDB):**
```bash
# Start Redis (if not already running)
docker run -d --name tessera-redis -p 6379:6379 redis:7-alpine

# Start MongoDB (if not already running)
docker run -d --name tessera-mongo -p 27017:27017 mongo:7
```

4. **Set up the Python AI service:**
```bash
cd apps/ai-service
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cd ../..
```

5. **Start all services in development mode:**
```bash
npm run dev
```

This single command will concurrently spin up the React frontend, the Socket.io sync server, the FastAPI service, and the BullMQ execution worker via Turborepo.


## 🗺️ Roadmap & Future Plans

We are actively building out the next phases of Tessera.io. If you are looking to contribute, these are our major upcoming milestones:

### 🎓 Phase 2: The "Socratic Mentor" AI Layer

To combat the rise of "vibe coding" (where developers blindly copy-paste AI code), we are building a deeply integrated, learning-focused AI mode.

* **Interactive Scaffolding:** The AI will refuse to write complete solutions. Instead, it will generate code skeletons with missing logic gates and interactive `// TODO` comments via the CRDT stream.
* **Live Runtime Interrogation:** When code fails in the Docker sandbox, the AI will intercept the logs and ask the user guiding questions about their variables rather than just printing the fix.

### 🌐 Phase 3: Integrated WebRTC

* Adding an A/V Selective Forwarding Unit (SFU) to enable seamless audio and video conferencing directly inside the collaborative workspace.
* Interactive multi-player whiteboard integration synced alongside the Monaco editor.

### 🐙 Phase 4: GitHub Integration

* Native OAuth GitHub app integration to fetch repositories, map file trees, and sync PRs and Issues directly into the workspace.
